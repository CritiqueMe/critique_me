    %h1 Privacy Policy
    %p This Privacy Policy was last modified in August 2012 (“Effective Date”).
    %p This CritiqueMe.com (“CritiqueMe,” “we” or “us”) Privacy Policy explains what personally identifiable information of yours is collected by CritiqueMe when you use our Services, how that information is used, and how you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of that information. This Privacy Policy sometimes refers to “personal information,” which for purposes of this Privacy Policy, is any information that can be used to directly contact or identify an individual, such as a full name or email address, as well as any information that is combined directly with such information. This Privacy Policy also governs any information that you may have provided to CritiqueMe prior to the Effective Date of this Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our Terms of Use.
    %p CritiqueMe may update its Privacy Policy from time to time, and so you should review this Policy periodically. When we change the policy in a material way, we will update the “last modified” date at the top of this Privacy Policy. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
    %h2 1.	Information Collection.
    %p A.	<b>User-Provided Information</b> You provide us information about yourself in various ways when you use the Services. For example, you provide us with information such as your name, e-mail address, and other personal information if you “follow,” “like,” or add a CritiqueMe application, link your account to the Services, or take similar action on Facebook or another third party website or network, or otherwise provide us with information when interacting with the Services.

    %p B.	<b>Cookies</b> When you visit the Services, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. A cookie may also convey information about how you browse the Services to us. A cookie does not collect personal information about you. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser's directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser.

However, some features of the Services may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.
    %p C.	<b>Clear Gifs</b> When you use the Services, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the usage patterns of our users on the Services. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. The information we collect from clear gifs used in email messages is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make CritiqueMe better for our users.
    %p D.	<b>Log Files</b> Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page or other web-based content. When you use the Services, our servers automatically record certain log file information.

We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to CritiqueMe or guarantee that your information on the Services may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. The privacy of your personal information may also be affected by changes to the functionality of CritiqueMe's distributors, such as social networks like Facebook, or the failure of privacy settings on such distributors' platforms. CritiqueMe is not responsible for the functionality or security measures of any third party.
    %h2 5.	How We Share Your Information
    %p Personally Identifiable Information: Except as described in this Privacy Policy, CritiqueMe will not share your personally identifiable information with others.
    %p CritiqueMe may share personal information with third parties for the purpose of providing the Services to you. If we do this, such third parties' use of your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy. We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of CritiqueMe (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).
    %p CritiqueMe may share information about you, including personal information, with CritiqueMe's corporate affiliates, including, without limitation, its parent company. CritiqueMe's corporate affiliates will use your personal information and other information in accordance with their own privacy policies.
    %p CritiqueMe also may share information about you, including personal information, with unaffiliated third parties. These third parties will use your personal information and other information in accordance with their own privacy policies. They may, for example, send advertisements and other information to you at your email address or other contact information that the third party may possess. If you want to opt-out from our sharing your personal information with unaffiliated third parties, you may send your opt-out request to us at #{mail_to "privacy@CritiqueMe.com"}. Opting-out from our disclosure of your personal information to unaffiliated third parties may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, offers, and information about other products and services of third parties.
    %p As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and other personal information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.
    %p Any information or content, including personal information, that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Services, such as Content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings. If you remove information that you posted to the Services, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Services, or if other Users have copied or saved that information.
    %p Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, CritiqueMe will not disclose personal information to any third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our Terms, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of CritiqueMe, our users or others.
    %p Non-Personally Identifiable Information: We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties for various purposes, including, without limitation, to help them understand the usage patterns for certain CritiqueMe services.
    %h2 6.	Compromise of Personal Information

    %h2 7.	Children
    %p Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.

If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at #{mail_to "privacy@CritiqueMe.com"} to let us know.
    %h2 8.	Notification Procedures
    %p It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, “push” notification, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on the Services, as determined by CritiqueMe in its sole discretion. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Privacy Policy.
    %h2 9.	Other Web Sites
    %p We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites or other services linked to or from the Services, nor the information or content contained therein.
